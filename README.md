My python learning projects

Hello World!

I'm a beginner Python developer.

This repository contains small Python scripts and exercises as I learn:
- Basics of Python
- Functions
- Loops
- Working with files
- Simple projects

I'm learning step by step and planning to contribute to open-source projects.
